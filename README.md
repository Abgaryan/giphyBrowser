# giphyBrowser

Context

A common pattern for a modern, consumer facing native mobile apps is interacting with a RESTful
service.
Your task is to build a GIF browser on Android, using Giphy’s /search endpoint and presenting the results
in a grid layout. The app should present the animated search results and offer a detail view, showing the
selected GIF in fullscreen.
Please follow the quick start guide ; you’ll need the generated key to establish a connection to their API.
Don’t worry it’s free and the rate limit is set to 10k requests per day - enough for testing.
